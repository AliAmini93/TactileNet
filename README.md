# TactileNet
TactileNet is a model based on deep learning that employs the convolutional neural network to classify tactile EEG data as input. The contemporary state-of-the-art TactileNet is inspired by models like EEGNet(https://github.com/vlawhern/arl-eegmodels), Inception, and SENet(https://github.com/hujie-frank/SENet).
